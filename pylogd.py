moment when batul tells you to ask the question.
[13:47] <kushal> As you all know, this is a completely free training, that also means if you
don't word hard and come up with questions or things you did not manage to learn, we may not
be able to help you out.

with green dots in front of them, they are the channel operators.

[14:02] <singh123> I have joined the mailing list but didnot get any mail till now.
[14:02] <shankarj67> Is there any video session also?
[14:02] <kushal> singh123, check for your spam
[14:02] <bhavin192> singh123, check spam
[14:02] <kushal> singh123, may have landed there.
[14:02] <kushal> shankarj67, nope.
[14:02] <sayan> shankarj67: no, all the session would be on IRC
[14:02] <shankarj67> ok then
[14:02] <kushal> Now, why IRC?
[14:02] <bhawana> k... do i need to have a great knowledge about any particular lang?
[14:02] <ndakota> !
[14:03] <ashwanig> bhawana: It's not k, It's Ok
[14:03] <kushal> Few reasons, most of the upstream open source projects or developers do
talk on IRC, it takes very less bandwidth, and works even on 2G.
[14:03] <kushal> ashwanig, Thank you :)
[14:03] <dhanesh95> bhawana: All you need to have is the willingness to learn.
[14:03] <kushal> bhawana, you may learn about Languages, but no lang.
[14:04] <bhawana> ok.. remember new time
[14:04] <kushal> During the sessions we try to make it a habit of staying online on IRC>
[14:05] <Pavan> !
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <kushal> At the end, generally it is the same group of people who stays late on IRC
and also get a lot of things done, and also become better upstream developers.
[14:05] <kushal> Because you will have to spend time to learn things.
[14:05] <ndakota> If someone asks a question, are there a set of people nominated to answer
or can anyone answer?<eof>
[14:05] <Pavan> not geting mail even spam also <eof>
[14:06] <kushal> ndakota, generally the sessions handlers, or anyone else can also answer.
[14:06] <saikat195> !
[14:06] <kushal> It depends on the nature of the question.
[14:06] <geekodour08> !
[14:06] <bhavin192> Pavan, wait for your turn
[14:06] <ashwanig> !
[14:06] <ndakota> @kushal Got it :)
[14:06] <kushal> Pavan, maybe no mails from the time you joined, wait for the end of the
sessions.

[14:08] <abdulwahababrar> kushal, If you allow me. Can I tell how to register nickname
please
[14:08] <kushal> so you are good.
[14:08] <kushal> abdulwahababrar, nope, people received enough number of links
[14:08] <fihae> !
[14:10] <kushal> abdulwahababrar, http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode
[14:10] <kushal> next
[14:10] <geekodour08> do I have to register somewhere, i filled the google form. is there
any verification mail that i should get?
[14:10] <fhackdroid> kushal: 182 nicks in the channel XD
[14:10] <kushal> fhackdroid, I see only 149
[14:11] <kushal> Everyone: you have to register your IRC nickname to the freenode server,
see this http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode
[14:11] <kushal> do it after the session.
[14:11] <sayan> The channel has a few admins, who monitor the channel.
[14:11] <abdulwahababrar> great!
[14:11] <sayan> As kushal told, if you are using xchat or HexChat you might see green dots
beside few of the nicknames
[14:11] <sayan> those are the channel ops
[14:11] <bhavin192> kushal, It shows 135 excluding ops
[14:12] <sayan> The op has the authorization to ban/kick a person from the channel
[14:13] <sayan> Also, during the session if the channel needs to go into full attention
mode, then the op can mute the channel
[14:13] <sitlanigaurav[m]> fhackdroid: Actually Matrix/Riot is showing more people online
[14:13] <fhackdroid> sitlanigaurav[m]: i realized
[14:13] <fhackdroid> s/i/I
[14:13] <sayan> I will explain these with an example. kushal asked a few times not to use !
but few people did continue even after that
[14:14] <vikram> #msg nickserv register helicalspring vikramverma1997@gmail.com
[14:14] <vivek_> :/
[14:14] <kushal> vikram, nice password,
[14:14] <mbtamuli12_> :D
[14:14] <wrik003> hahaha
[14:14] <abdulwahababrar> haha
[14:14] <proishan11_> lol
[14:14] <rimshakhan> :D
[14:14] <sharan_> hahaha
[14:14] <fihae> lol
[14:14] <kvy> lol
[14:14] <bhavin192> vikram, use / instead of #
[14:14] <sayan> so in that case the the op can mute the channel, and nobody can speak other
that the ops
[14:14] <saikat195> Do it in the status tab, vikram
[14:15] <abdulwahababrar> vikram remember to change password this time
[14:15] <_bhargav> so now I'm wondering how commonly does vikram use that password
[14:15] <wrik003> lol
[14:15] <shivamA1> haha
[14:15] <kushal> sayan, mute the channel
[14:16] <kushal> sayan, go ahead with your explanation
[14:16] <sayan> So this is a mute mode
[14:17] <sayan> When a channel is moderated, only voices and above can speak.
[14:17] <sayan> voices mean that the op can give person to speak in the channel
[14:17] <sayan> like kushal gave voice to batul and tenida`
[14:17] <kushal> #hello
[14:18] <kushal> Here batul can speak
[14:18] <fhackdroid> and ops as well
[14:18] <kushal> Now,
[14:19] <geekodour08> ?
[14:19] <avik> We can speak!
[14:19] <dodococo> testing

[14:55] <kushal> and also https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[14:55] <skarpy> It's nothing, I was impatient about the class to start <eof>
[14:55] <kushal> next
[14:55] <apoorv> Everybody was talking about pycon and wanted to know about pycon delhi can
anybody guide me?
[14:55] <apoorv> <eof>
[14:55] <kushal> apoorv, There is only PyCon India happening at Delhi, and PyDelhi
conference.
[14:56] <sayan> we don't know of PyCon Delhi
[14:56] <apoorv> When does it happen?
[14:56] <kushal> apoorv, using google.com to search.
[14:56] <kushal> apoorv, google for pycon india 2017
[14:56] <sayan> apoorv: and we can have the discussion after the session, if you have doubts
[14:57] <apoorv> Actually their pages is only showing about their 2016 conference
[14:57] <kushal> Both the logs from mbuf are your homework, read them carefully and also go
through the pdf presentations mentioned in the log.
[14:57] <apoorv> Okay
[14:57] <kvy> kushal : ok
[14:58] <jiteshpabla> !
[14:58] <kushal> apoorv, I found
https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2017/blob/master/index.html
[14:58] <kushal> next
[14:58] <kushal> next
[14:58] <ashwanig> When any off-topic talk is going on the channel, should we also stay
online then? And what does the messages with slashes / mean? like s/i/l <eof>
[14:58] <dhairyya> Batul missed me out
[14:59] <dhairyya> I was before ashwanig
[14:59] <apoorv> kushal: thank you
[14:59] <bhavin192> No he didn't
[14:59] <shivamA1> he didn't
[14:59] <kushal> next
[14:59] <jiteshpabla> Is there a way to make the class-logs more readable?
[15:00] <ndakota> ashwanig : Second part of your question = means (s) substitute (i) instead
of (l)
[15:00] <kushal> dhairyya, batul received your message later than ashwanig
[15:00] <kushal> next
[15:00] <jiteshpabla> as clients make irc more readable
[15:00] <dhairyya> !
[15:00] <_bhargav> ashwanig: the slash commands are generally for intimating typos. The
syntax comes from the linux `sed` command.
[15:00] <kushal> next
[15:01] <sayan> jiteshpabla: do you mean the IRC clients more readable?
[15:01] <dhairyya> Some ops name are in black,some are in grey?<eof>
[15:01] <mbtamuli12_> jiteshpabla: Well, you can always use python to remove unnecessary
lines from the logs. ;) Also, you'll get them here. https://dgplug.org/irclogs/
[15:01] <bhavin192> dhairyya, they are away, not online
[15:01] <sayan> and the logs are not? You can always add CSS to the logs, use Python to
remove lines
[15:01] <_bhargav> ashwanig: s/linux/gnu <eof>
[15:02] <ashwanig> _bhargav: got it :)
[15:02] <kushal> next
[15:02] <bhavin192> dhairyya, you can right click and see the information, there you will
see the away message
[15:02] <jiteshpabla> @sayan ok!
[15:03] <jiteshpabla> !
[15:03] <devesh_verma_> has todays class ended ?
[15:03] <bhavin192> devesh_verma_, not yet

[15:03] <kushal> next
[15:03] <anwesha> Sorry for this out of turn introduction, hi I am Anwesha, a mom, who was
busy helping her toddler girl in the pee, so missed the introduction.
[15:03] <tnsittpsif> !
[15:04] <jiteshpabla> is there anything else to be dicussed in this session?
[15:04] <kushal> next
[15:04] <kushal> jiteshpabla, everyday is a surprise in these sessions.
[15:04] <tnsittpsif> How to read the channel topic? I use Weechat.
[15:04] <tnsittpsif> <eof>
[15:04] <kushal> As I said earlier, we want people to stay online as much as possible.
[15:05] <kushal> next

[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <_bhargav> my question was answered https://github.com/kushaldas/ircbot this is
batul's code right?
[15:08] <balaji> How to mention the others username ?
[15:08] <kushal> _bhargav, yes
[15:08] <balaji> <eom>
[15:08] <singh123> !
[15:08] <kushal> balaji, type the first few characters, and then press TAB?
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <bhavin192> balaji, just type their name
[15:09] <kushal> balaji, ^^^ or what bhavin192 said.
[15:09] <balaji> kushal, bhavin192 thanks :)
[15:09] <singh123> is there any way to divide class timing in groups as we have to wait a
lot.
[15:09] <kushal> singh123, Nope.
[15:09] <kushal> singh123, wait for what?
[15:10] <singh123> this long introduction session
[15:10] <bhargav> !
[15:10] <ahole[m]> !
[15:10] <kushal> singh123, Yes, because this is introduction.
[15:10] <kushal> singh123, We are learning in a group, and a group progresses based the
slowest team-mate.
[15:10] <kushal> Not the fastest.
[15:10] <kushal> Team work is important.
[15:10] <kushal> next
[15:10] <singh123> ok understood
[15:10] <kushal> next
[15:10] <bhavin192> singh123, we will learn from everyone's questions too
[15:11] <kushal> bhavin192, Correct, that is why we all learn here.
[15:11] <kushal> There is no one who can say that everything is done for them.
[15:12] <bhargav> i was out and missed my introduction. i am bhargav tamuli i have done ECE
from GIMT, assam
[15:12] <ahole[m]> which is the best library for graphics in Python ?
[15:12] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:12] <geekodour08> hey bhargav, hi
[15:13] <kushal> bhargav, full form of GIMT?
[15:13] <bhargav> hey
[15:13] <bhavin192> bhargav, what is ECE?
[15:13] <kushal> ahole[m], depends, we can talk later and find out your requirements.
[15:13] <avik> !
[15:13] <dodococo> !
[15:13] <kushal> Then we can suggest something.
[15:13] <kushal> next
[15:13] <bhargav> girijananda institute of management and technology
[15:13] <ashwanig> bhavin192: Electronics and communication engineering
[15:13] <avik> what is ping timeout? and how to stop it?
[15:14] <kushal> avik, means you are getting disconnected.
[15:14] <kushal> You need a better ISP.
[15:14] <kushal> next
[15:14] <dodococo> OSS or competitive coding , which improves my coding skills more
[15:14] <avik> thanks!
[15:14] <shreyab25> I had net issues and missed my intro, i am shreya from cummins college
pune
[15:14] <kvy> !
[15:14] <kushal> sayan, saptaks do you people want to reply to dodococo ?
[15:14] <bhargav> electronics and communication engineering @bhavin192
[15:15] <saptaks> kushal sure
[15:15] <sayan> kushal: sure
[15:15] <sayan> saptaks: go ahead
[15:15] <sayan> I will add points and my thoughts after that
[15:16] <wrik003__> !
[15:16] <ahole[m]> !
[15:16] <kushal> dodococo, That is a good question to ask in day 1.
[15:16] <nisha_> !
[15:16] <im_mohsin> dodococo, both. I have been doing Competitve programming and now getting
started OSS. i think depends alot on what you enjoy. Fo me Competitve programming is fun and
addictive as i learn lot of new Algorithms and Data structures during long contest<eom>
[15:16] <saptaks> dodococo: I think OSS gives you more exposure to know how real life
softwares work. In competitive coding you do get to learn the basics and improve your
logics. But in OSS you get to learn how actually things work.
[15:16] <saptaks> In OSS you will actually get a real life scenario.
[15:17] <saptaks> In competitive coding you might be presented with a scenario which you
might never face.
[15:17] <Priyansh> I too missed my intro. Sorry!
[15:17] <kushal> Priyansh, type it out now.
[15:17] <im_mohsin> saptaks, true.. Competitve programming improves problem solving ability
which might help in OSS :)
[15:17] <Priyansh> I'm Priyansh from Dr. BC Roy engineering college Durgapur
[15:18] <kushal> im_mohsin, There is only one . after the end of an English sentence.
[15:18] <kushal> im_mohsin, Every time you type extra, it creates extra heat, which is bad
for the planet Earth.
[15:18] <dodococo> Thank you, can i get started in both at the same time?
[15:18] <dodococo> !
[15:18] <dodococo> sorry
[15:18] <sayan> Both of them are required. Contributing to open source helps know
technologies, tools and build real softwares
[15:19] <im_mohsin> kushal, sorry. Just got used to it :)
[15:19] <fhackdroid> sayan: your take on this ?
[15:19] <sayan> that people/companies/other fellow open source contributors use
[15:20] <dodococo> okay, got it. Thank you sayan saptaks im_mohsin
[15:20] <sayan> Competitive is good, but it should be more like learning algorithms, maths
and how you can use them
[15:20] <kushal> next
[15:20] <sayan> in real life scenarios
[15:20] <kvy> what is this ISP. and OSS and competitive coding.
[15:21] <rahuldecoded_> ISP: internet service provider
[15:21] <sayan> The focus should be algorithms rather than competitive programming
[15:21] <balaji> kvy, OSS open source contribution
[15:21] <dhairyya> The one that provides you with a public IP
[15:21] <kvy> ok
[15:21] <_bhargav> kvy: OSS: Open Source Software
[15:21] <bhavin192> dhairyya, no, not necessary to have public IP
[15:21] <shankarj67> Kvy, ISP is internet service provider, mobile Sim you are using for
internet in most cases
[15:22] <sayan> because, if you don't know algorithms you might be try to solve a problem,
and people might have already written good algorithm for those scenarios
[15:22] <kvy> don't confuse me
[15:22] <kvy> in
[15:22] <kvy> oss
[15:22] <kvy> <eof>
[15:22] <sayan> fhackdroid: that's my take :) Open Source & Algorithms
[15:22] <im_mohsin> Competitve programming involves solving programming problem in sites
like Hackerrank, codechef and websites alike
[15:23] <kvy> ok
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:23] <wrik003__> how do i do this: "fhackdroid waiting to hear this answer"? <eof>
[15:23] <kushal> wrik003__, write this
[15:23] <kushal> wrik003__, /me is learning
[15:23] <bhavin192> wrik003__, type /me and message
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:24] <kushal> next
[15:24] <nisha_> Kushal, how can i improve my computer knowledge because i does not know
much about computer science.<eof>
[15:24] <fhackdroid> wrik003__: magic :P
[15:24] <dodococo> I got my answers
[15:24] <ahole[m]> Does solving project Euler problem improve coding skills ?
[15:24] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:24] <kushal> nisha_, I hope this training will help you in that (slowly).
[15:24] <kushal> ahole[m], somewhat yes.
[15:24] <fhackdroid> sayan: thanks :)
[15:24] <sayan> nisha_: stay online after the sessions, read a lot, ask questions here
[15:24] <ahole[m]> !
[15:24] <kushal> next
[15:24] <acetakwas> ahole[m]:: It improves your algorithms skill
[15:24] <shankarj67> kvy, open source software, which one is available online for developers
to modify the codes and improve the performance of that software.
[15:25] <SpEcHiDeR> fhackdroid, why is it displaying like this:
@freenode_fhackdroid:matrix.org instead of your nickname?
[15:25] <nisha_> Kushal and Sayan thak you.
[15:25] <kushal> nisha_, like you are not from Computer Science background, anwesha is from
Legal background (she is a lawyer).
[15:25] <kushal> next
[15:25] <ahole[m]> Most of the problems under project Euler are mathematical problems how do
you apply them in real life use cases ?
[15:25] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:25] <kushal> ahole[m], I don't know how, I did not ever :)
[15:25] <kushal> ahole[m], I am bad at maths anyway.
[15:26] <im_mohsin> ahole[m], project Euler will help you very much in math concept as well
[15:26] <ahole[m]> Same here .
[15:26] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:26] <kushal> In one of the days we will learn about history of Free Software and other
important parts.
[15:26] <kvy> shankarj67 ok i was try codechef
[15:26] <kvy> but
[15:26] <kvy> that
[15:27] <bhavin192> kvy, i or I ?
[15:27] <kvy> do'nt accept anything.
[15:27] <kvy> <eof>
[15:27] <kushal> next
[15:28] <kushal> Roll Call for tonight
[15:28] <bhavin192> kvy, sorry but I want to break your habit of i :P
[15:28] <shankarj67> kvy, codechef is online competetive programming platform to improve
your coding and algorithm skills.
[15:28] <kushal> Kushal Das
[15:28] <sayan> ahole[m]: you really don't do that in day to day life, but while building
architectures for a product you generally need these skills
